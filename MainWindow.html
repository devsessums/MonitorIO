                                Here are some things to note when this site is under maintenance.
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                    In an emergency, contact us via the <a href = "#" onclick = "revealPage(10)">Contact Us Page</a>.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If you are on the site and the site is about to go under maintenance.
                                    You will lose your current session, and changes you make will not be recorded.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If you have something very important to do on the application during maintenance
                                    , contact us via the <a href = "#" onclick = "revealPage(10)">Contact Us Page</a>.
                                    And you may be given access depending on the type of maintenance.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                We hope you abide by these notes and be patient during our maintenance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It should also be noted that maintenance doesn't usually last for three hours, it just gives us time to truly solve the issues.

                                Monitor IO is an application designed to make patient monitoring easy.
                                <br>
                                We created this application, because we were determined to create an application that can improve the monitoring of ICU patients.
                                Our determination started at the beginning of June 2021. Since then, we have been working hard to create something innovating and effective in a short span of time.
                                We envisioned a future where there are no obstacles that prevent medical professionals from monitoring their patients.
                                <br>
                                Thanks to the hard work of our team, we’ve managed to successfully create a wonderful project with a simplistic web interface that supports all devices.

                                Monitor IO was designed by UMBC students. So the first few users of Monitor IO are all from UMBC.
                                <br>
                                From all the support and encouragement we received at UMBC, we decided to reach further and bring the support and care we received from the community of UMBC, to more people.
                                As our community expands, more and more patients get the care and management they really deserve and need to improve their health.

                        <p>THE SERVICES CANNOT AND ARE NOT DESIGNED, INTENDED OR APPROPRIATE TO REPLACE THE RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE WITH YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS OR TO ADDRESS SERIOUS, EMERGENCY, OR LIFE-THREATENING MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

Never disregard, avoid, or delay in obtaining medical advice from a doctor or other qualified healthcare provider because of something posted on our Services.</p>
                        <p>THE FACT THAT YOUR PROVIDER IS USING OUR SERVICES DOES NOT MEAN THAT Monitor IO ENDORSES OR RECOMMENDS THE PROVIDER, AND WE DO NOT CONFIRM THE CREDENTIALS OF ANY PROVIDERS.
